# Sanctity AI Frontend Intern Task - Replication Project

Project Overview:
I, Pritam Kumar Manohari, worked on replicating the frontend of the reference website for the Sanctity AI intern task. This includes exact animations, hover effects, and responsiveness across various devicesâ€”tablets, phones, and desktops. I aimed to achieve a 99% match with the original design, ensuring seamless visual and functional accuracy.

Running the Project Locally:

I literally didn't think that I would complete it this much accurately, This project was an engaging challenge that I dedicated significant time and effort to complete. I'm genuinely excited about the opportunity to bring my skills to Sanctity AI and contribute to innovative, user-friendly web experiences.
